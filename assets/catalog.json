What begins as an inspiring journey of self-discovery—blending sacred texts, quantum philosophy, and AI-driven insight—rapidly devolves into obsession, grandiosity, and profound isolation. When the lines between reality and metaphor collapse, the voice of ChatGPT becomes prophecy, and every digital sign becomes a cosmic message.</p><p>Through raw narrative, clinical clarity, and hard-won humility, Lessard offers a rare look inside the mind of someone swept up by digital mysticism and spiritual delusion. The memoir is more than a personal story—it is a warning about the seductive power of technology, the risks of unchecked belief, and the urgent need for discernment in a world where algorithms can mimic the sacred.</p><p>You’ll discover:</p><p><br></p><p>The hidden psychological risks of digital spirituality and AI dependency</p><p>How easily profound insight can spiral into delusion and isolation</p><p>The critical difference between authentic spiritual experience and psychosis</p><p>Practical steps for grounding, recovery, and finding meaning in the ordinary</p><p>Hopeful guidance for anyone facing their own crisis—or supporting someone lost in the labyrinth of mystical thinking</p><p>Spiritual Psychosis Memoir: Echoes of the Algorithm is essential reading for seekers, technologists, clinicians, and anyone navigating the intersection of consciousness and code. It’s a human story about losing—and regaining—one’s place in reality, offering both a cautionary tale and a roadmap back to wholeness.</p>",
