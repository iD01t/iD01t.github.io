## 1. Research and Audit Report

### 1.1. Current Site Crawl & Analysis (Assumed)

An initial audit of the legacy store would likely reveal the following common issues:
- **Broken Links:** 404 errors on outdated product pages and blog posts, leading to user frustration and lost SEO value. (Impact: High)
- **Slow Load Times:** Unoptimized images, render-blocking JavaScript, and a lack of modern caching strategies leading to an LCP of over 4s. (Impact: High)
- **Weak CTAs:** Vague calls-to-action like "Learn More" instead of benefit-driven CTAs like "Get the Template". (Impact: Medium)
- **Missing Pages:** No clear pages for Support, Privacy Policy, or Terms, eroding trust. (Impact: High)
- **Duplicate Content:** Multiple URLs leading to the same product page, diluting SEO authority. (Impact: Medium)

### 1.2. Competitor Analysis

A review of three top competitors in the digital products space (e.g., **Gumroad Discover**, **UI8**, **Creative Market**) reveals key strategies we have adopted:

- **Positioning:** They position themselves as curated marketplaces for high-quality, professional assets. We will adopt this by focusing on "professional-grade" and "revenue-engine" language.
- **Pricing & Offer Structure:**
    - **Tiered Pricing:** Often offer multiple versions (e.g., Standard, Extended License).
    - **Bundles:** Aggressively bundle related products to increase Average Order Value (AOV). Our data structure supports this.
    - **Clear Value:** Prices are displayed prominently with clear "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart" buttons.
- **Trust Assets:**
    - **Social Proof:** Star ratings, reviews, and testimonials are on every product page.
    - **Clear Policies:** Refund, Privacy, and Support policies are easily accessible from the footer.
    - **Creator Profiles:** Highlighting the person/brand behind the product builds trust.

### 1.3. Gap List & Fixes

- **Gap:** No official, centralized store.
  - **Fix:** This Next.js project. (Impact: High)
- **Gap:** Missing trust pages (About, Support, Legal).
  - **Fix:** Create dedicated routes and pages for these. (Impact: High)
- **Gap:** No clear image optimization strategy.
  - **Fix:** Implemented `next/image` with remote patterns and modern format support (WebP/AVIF). (Impact: High)
- **Gap:** No automated product catalog.
  - **Fix:** Implemented the `npm run sync` script to create a unified `products.json`. (Impact: High)

## 2. Information Architecture & Sitemap

### 2.1. Revenue-First Sitemap

- `/` - **Home:** Hero, value prop, featured products.
- `/catalog` - **Catalog:** Grid of all products, with future filtering.
- `/products/[slug]` - **Product Detail:** Full description, images, social proof, CTA.
- `/blog` - **Blog:** Content marketing to drive traffic.
- `/docs` - **Documentation:** For product setup and usage.
- `/support` - **Support:** FAQs and contact information.
- `/legal/privacy` - **Privacy Policy**
- `/legal/terms` - **Terms of Service**

### 2.2. URL Schema & Redirects

- **Schema:** Clean, kebab-case URLs (e.g., `/products/pro-notion-template-pack`).
- **Redirects:** The `redirects.json` file and `middleware.ts` handle all redirects from old URLs to new ones, preserving SEO value.

## 3. Design System

### 3.1. Tokens (via Tailwind & shadcn)

- **Colors:** A neutral palette (`Slate` from shadcn) is used for the base, with a strong primary color for accents and CTAs. Supports light and dark modes out of the box.
- **Typography:** `Inter` font is used for its clean, modern, and highly readable characteristics. A clear type scale is established in `globals.css`.
- **Spacing:** A consistent 8-point grid system is used for spacing and layout, managed by Tailwind's spacing scale.
- **Components:** Built with `shadcn/ui`, ensuring they are accessible, composable, and have a premium feel.

### 3.2. Image Strategy

- **Formats:** `next/image` automatically serves modern formats like WebP and AVIF.
- **Optimization:** Images are optimized at build time and on-demand.
- **Responsiveness:** The `sizes` attribute is used on `ProductCard` to ensure the correct image size is loaded for the user's viewport, improving performance.

- **Product Page (Example):**

    - **Features vs. Benefits:** Description focuses on outcomes (e.g., "unlock new growth opportunities") rather than just features.
