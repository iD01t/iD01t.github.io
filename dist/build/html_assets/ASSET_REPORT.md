## Image Quality Assessment

### High Quality (Recommended for Production)
- **Bedtime Story Maker screenshots** - Clear, professional app visuals
- **Book covers from Google Books** - High-resolution, professional quality
- **Brand images from id01t.ca** - Official, high-quality brand assets

### Medium Quality (Suitable for Development)
- **GitHub achievement badges** - Good for placeholder/background use
- **Itch.io app screenshots** - Decent quality, suitable for previews

### Low Quality (Consider Replacement)
- **Some Google Play book covers** - Lower resolution variants
- **Generic placeholder images** - Temporary until better assets available

## Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Homepage hero image
- Store product cards (3/3)
- eBook catalog (6/6)
- Apps showcase (3/3)
- Portfolio page (6/6 projects with real images)
- About page founder image
- Music page albums (3/3 with images)
- Contact page brand image

### üîÑ In Progress

### ‚ùå Pending
- Logo optimization
- Favicon creation

- Additional portfolio assets

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Optimize large images** - Several app screenshots are over 2MB
2. **Create consistent logo set** - Need logo.svg, logo-512.png, favicon.ico
3. **Generate OG cover image** - Create 1200x630 hero image for social sharing

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Replace placeholder images** with higher quality alternatives
2. **Add portfolio case study images** from actual projects
3. **Create music album artwork** for music page
4. **Optimize image formats** - Convert to WebP where possible

### Long-term Goals
1. **Establish brand image guidelines** for consistent visual identity
2. **Create custom photography** for services and about pages
3. **Develop icon system** for consistent UI elements
4. **Implement image CDN** for better performance

## File Size Optimization

### Current Issues
- App screenshots: 1.4MB - 2.2MB each (should be <500KB)
- Some book covers: ~50KB (acceptable)
- Placeholder images: 100KB - 250KB (acceptable)

### Optimization Targets
- **Hero images**: <500KB
- **Product images**: <300KB
- **Thumbnails**: <100KB
- **Icons**: <50KB

## Technical Notes

### Harvesting Script
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Dependencies**: requests, beautifulsoup4
- **Features**: Automatic image filtering, size validation, category organization
- **Output**: Structured JSON mapping, organized file structure

## Conclusion

The image harvesting process successfully collected 56 images from 15 out of 17 target URLs. The quality and variety of harvested assets provide a solid foundation for the website, though some optimization and additional custom assets are needed for a complete professional appearance.

**Next Steps**: Focus on image optimization, create missing brand assets, and replace remaining placeholder images with harvested or custom alternatives.
